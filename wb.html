                                <p>Wanna hear a secret? This is kinda embarrassin, but... I used to have a dream
                                    once,
                                    like Pete
                                    does now. Yeah. I know, I'm still younger than him with a long future ahead of
                                    me.
                                    But what
                                    could I do? Life's too rough for that. Others say that Rats are a pathetic bunch
                                    who
                                    were
                                    too incompetent to join even the smallest Syndicate let alon a Wing. Filthy
                                    losers
                                    who feed
                                    on junk and leftovers, not making any effort to change...</p>
                                <p>Back when I was a young kid, I didn't like that. I thought I was better than
                                    those
                                    Rats. So I
                                    decided to get into an examinee town. Little did I know that it'd be the one
                                    choice
                                    I'd
                                    regret the most... I begged and nagged at my parents, wanting to achieve that
                                    stupid
                                    dream.
                                    How'd it go, you ask? Seems you're just as stupid, aren't you. I wouldn't be
                                    hanging
                                    out
                                    with these folks if I made it, now would I?</p>
                                <p>What I'm saying is, dreaming won't do jack shit for you. They didn't end up here
                                    because they
                                    gave up trying. Hell, they wouldn't have set foot on this gutter in the first
                                    place
                                    if they
                                    had what it takes to achieve their dreams. You get it now? Pete's a huge idiot.

                                <p>Didja know? There's grades for each alley in
                                    the Backstreets. Funny, ain't it. Trash in a trash can are grading each other...
                                    The
                                    parts
                                    that're under the protection of a Syndicate, Office, or Association are pretty
                                    safe,
                                    Sweepers
                                    can't raid those streets easily. Putting the people who live there in a
                                    different
                                    grade from
                                    those who don't, though... is pointless, honestly speaking. Sure, it's a bit
                                    safer
                                    over
                                    there,
                                    but we're talking about the Backstreets, get it?</p>
                                <p>You know what's funnier? Even kids would group themselves according to what part
                                    of
                                    the
                                    streets they live in, They's even shun the others whose clothes or manner didn't
                                    fit
                                    their
                                    turf's style. I had no choice but to accept this sad truth.</p>
                                <p>You wonderin' how things were in the alleys I lived? Couldn't afford to pay
                                    protection fees
                                    to a Syndicate, so the Sweepers came down at night and collected most of my
                                    neighbors. I had
                                    to witness 'em take chunks of fless outta my parents and brothers while they
                                    were
                                    still
                                    breathing. Don't pity me, though. My story ain't nothing special around here.

                                <p>There's not a lot of peeps who hang around in the Backstreets alone. It's cuz
                                    that's
                                    just
                                    madness. Weak and dowdy folks gotta band together to survive. Get into a small
                                    Syndicate or
                                    anything and make a living somehow. Some ignorant fool makes a scene in the
                                    Backstreets on
                                    their own, they're just making themselves a target as soon as others notice
                                    they're
                                    alone.
                                    That's why we move in groups. We're called Rats for a reason. We crawl about the
                                    dark in
                                    parks, and jump at prey for the chance to bite 'em apart when we spot one.</p>
                                <p>So, you wondering if we Rats have any dreams? Hmmm... I guess belonging to a
                                    proper
                                    Syndicate, if any. We're just too tacky and amateurish to be called one. We hate
                                    being bound
                                    to rules, so hell'll freeze over before one of us joins an Office, and no Rat I
                                    know
                                    would
                                    move to an examinee town and study for Wing entrance exams. Those nerds at
                                    examinee
                                    towns
                                    ain't too different from Rats like us. We're all dreaming silly dreams that'll
                                    never
                                    come
                                    true with out petty skills. An Office, a Wing, a Syndicate, or whatever... Think
                                    it's an
                                    easy task to belong to a decent group? People just accept what they got and live
                                    on.
                                    But
                                    still, I wanted to have a dream.</p>

                                <p>I frankly don't recommend replacing your entire body with a machine. Especially with
                                    a cheap one. Aside from basic issues such as vulnerability to damage and creaky
                                    noises, cheap prosthetic bodies compromise too much. You're basically giving up all
                                    the joys of life. Can you imagine? You can't taste anything when you eat delicious
                                    food, and you can't feel the softness and coziness of a good bed. You can't feel
                                    anything get stuck in your body, be it a piece of paper or a knife. The head
                                    remembers those feelings, but you can't experience them again.</p>
                                <p>There are ways to overcome it, though. You can buy a desire stimulation chip and plug
                                    it in your brain, inject medications, or use other methods. They're just absurdly
                                    expensive. You're better off saving up for a more expensive prosthetic body if you
                                    really want your senses back. High quality, pricey bodies come with sensory organs.
                                    As I always say, it's all about money in this world.</p>

                                <p>What's your favorite food? That's the question I used to ask the most when I still
                                    had a human body. I love… looooove eating. Talking about food was a huge delight for
                                    me. We would share each other's tastes and preferences, and sometimes head to a
                                    restaurant for a meal just like that.</p>
                                <p>But now… My body's a machine as you can see. I can't taste anything anymore. Thanks
                                    for pointing that out. Mo told me to stop dreaming about it. I still wanna try more
                                    delicious foods, though. Hot and flavorful… Spicy and sweet… Stuff like that. I
                                    guess this body is too cheap to restrain delusional thoughts like this. If we get
                                    more money and change our bodies to new ones… then maybe I'll be able to stop these
                                    thoughts from getting in the way of my work?</p>

                                <p>The City consists of 25 Nests, and 25 Districts of the Backstreets that surround
                                    those Nests. And countless Offices and Syndicates reside in the Backstreets. You
                                    know what's a surefire way for a Syndicate to make a name for itself among all the
                                    competitors? The simplest method is Office raiding. You literally storm into an
                                    Office and wreak havoc on it.</p>
                                <p>You never know who will be the winner until you fight. It could stop at a good
                                    beating and one side surrendering, but some Syndicates raid Offices out of pure
                                    boredom and kill everyone. Each Syndicate has its own way of operation. It goes
                                    without saying that the Syndicate has more fame to gain out of raiding a high-grade
                                    Office filled with seasoned Fixers. So the Offices have to stay sharp at all times.
                                    But you'll also have to watch it. If you misjudge your opponents, you'll end up dead
                                    before you could try anything…</p>
